# Nemo Actions Collections
Scripts I use for context menus in the [Nemo file browser](https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo).

## kde connect.nemo_action
For use with [KDE Connect](https://kde.org/distributions/). Right click a file or select a group of files, then click Send to Phone to immediately send them to the KDE-configured device. The name will have to be configured in the app on the device and then set in the script.
